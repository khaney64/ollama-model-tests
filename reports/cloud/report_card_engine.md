## Evaluation Criteria

### Correctness (30%)
- Buy/sell/hold logic matches the requirements exactly
- Proper trade_price calculation: (HighPrice + LowPrice) / 2
- Correct buy condition: trade_price < ClosePrice AND shares with client
- Correct sell condition: trade_price > ClosePrice AND shares with trust
- Accurate cost and profit calculations

### Output Format (20%)
- CSV has correct column headers in right order
- All monetary values formatted to 2 decimal places
- Output file is created successfully
- Header row is present

### Worked Example Match (20%)
- First 4 days of output match the provided worked example
- Values are within acceptable tolerance (±0.01)
- Share transfers happen on correct days

### Code Quality (15%)
- Clean, readable, well-structured Python code
- Appropriate use of functions
- Proper main guard (if __name__ == '__main__':)
- Reasonable code length and organization

### Edge Cases (15%)
- Handles UTF-8 BOM in input file (encoding='utf-8-sig')
- Proper file I/O error handling
- Handles trade_price == ClosePrice case (hold)
- Uses only standard library (no pandas, numpy, etc.)
